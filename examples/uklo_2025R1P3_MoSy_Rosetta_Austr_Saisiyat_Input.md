# Context

Saisiyat is an indigenous language spoken by the Saisiyat people in the mountainous regions of North-West Taiwan. It is spoken by just under 6,000 people. It is considered endangered as few young people use it, but in recent years with help from the Taiwanese government, there is an effort to save Saisiyat as an indigenous language.
