# Core Grammatical Generalizations

1.  **Word Order:** Subject — Verb — [(`ka`) Direct Object] — [(`ka` / `no`) Indirect Object].
2.  **Direct Object (DO):** Normally preceded by `ka`.
    *   *Exception:* When the verb creates the object (e.g., `komaat` “write” creates `kakinaat` “letter”), the DO is not preceded by `ka`.
3.  **Indirect Object / Recipient (IO):** Choice between `ka` and `no` is pragmatic:
    *   `ka` = proximate / close (physical proximity, kinship/own child, positive affect, physically handing).
    *   `no` = distant / alienated (spatial distance, sending/writing, emotional distance / dislike, strangers).
4.  **Pronouns:** Reflect the same distinction:
    *   `hisia` = proximate
    *   `‘inisia` = distant

## Distribution Matrix (Recipient Marking)

| Verb | Recipient Marking | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `komaat` (write) | `no` | Writing implies distance (recipient not present). |
| `somatel` (send) | `no` | Sending implies distance. |
| `mobay` (give) | `ka` or `no` | `ka` if recipient is own/close/present; `no` if distant/alienated. |
| `saeoe` (offer) | `ka` or `no` | Context determines choice (proximate vs distant). |
| `pasibaeaeh` (lend) | `ka` or `no` | Context determines choice (closeness vs distance). |

# Detailed Breakdowns

## Part 1 (Translate into Saisiyat)

**10. English: The child writes mother a letter.**
*   **Answer:** `Korkoring komaat kakinaat no ‘oya’.`
*   **Segmentation:** `Korkoring` | `komaat` | `kakinaat` | `no ‘oya’`
    *   `Korkoring` = subject (child)
    *   `komaat` = write (verb that creates the object)
    *   `kakinaat` = letter (created object → no `ka`)
    *   `no ‘oya` = recipient mother marked as distant (writing → recipient is not physically present)
*   **Justification:** `komaat` creates `kakinaat` so DO is unmarked by `ka`; writing implies recipient is not present → IO uses `no`.

**11. English: The father gives him some aubergine. [The father is angry with him]**
*   **Answer:** `Yaba’ mobay ka talor ‘inisia.`
*   **Segmentation:** `Yaba’` | `mobay` | `ka talor` | `‘inisia`
    *   `Yaba’` = subject (father)
    *   `mobay` = give
    *   `ka talor` = DO aubergine (existing item → `ka`)
    *   `‘inisia` = distant recipient pronoun (father angry with him → emotional distance)
*   **Justification:** DO gets `ka`; angry/distant recipient → use distal pronoun `‘inisia` (not `ka`).

**12. English: She gives him some sweet potato. [She is not angry with him]**
*   **Answer:** `Sia mobay ka ‘aewpir hisia.`
*   **Segmentation:** `Sia` | `mobay` | `ka ‘aewpir` | `hisia`
    *   `Sia` = 3sg subject
    *   `mobay` = give
    *   `ka ‘aewpir` = DO sweet potato (existing → `ka`)
    *   `hisia` = proximate recipient pronoun (she is not angry / close)
*   **Justification:** proximate/positive relation → `hisia`.

**13. English: The child offers the old man some sweet potato. [Old man away in hospital; child sends sweet potato into hospital for him]**
*   **Answer:** `Korkoring saeoe ka ‘aewpir no tatini’.`
*   **Segmentation:** `Korkoring` | `saeoe` | `ka ‘aewpir` | `no tatini’`
    *   `Korkoring` = subject
    *   `saeoe` = offer (but context is sending to hospital)
    *   `ka ‘aewpir` = DO sweet potato (existing → `ka`)
    *   `no tatini’` = IO old man marked `no` because he is away/in hospital (distant)
*   **Justification:** physical distance → use `no`.

## Part 2 (Translate Saisiyat → English; include possible context)

**14. Saisiyat: `Yaba’ mobay ka rayhil ‘inisia.`**
*   **Gloss + translation:** `Yaba’` (father) `mobay` (gives) `ka rayhil` (money) `‘inisia` (him-distant).
*   **English:** The father gives him money. [Context option: he is far away / father doesn't like him]
*   **Rationale:** recipient is distal (`‘inisia`) — physical or emotional distance.

**15. Saisiyat: `‘Oya’ pasibaeaeh ka kaibaaen no korkoring.`**
*   **Gloss + translation:** `‘Oya’` (mother) `pasibaeaeh` (lends) `ka kaibaaen` (clothes) `no korkoring` (child-distal).
*   **English:** The mother lends the child clothes. [Context option: not her child / she is angry / the child is far away]
*   **Rationale:** IO marked `no` indicates distance/alienation.

**16. Saisiyat: `‘Oya’ pasibaeaeh ka kaibaaen ka korkoring.`**
*   **Gloss + translation:** `‘Oya’` (mother) `pasibaeaeh` (lends) `ka kaibaaen` (clothes) `ka korkoring` (child-proximate).
*   **English:** The mother lends the child clothes. [Context option: it is her child / child is present / closeness]
*   **Rationale:** IO marked `ka` indicates proximity/positive relation.

## Part 3 (Translate into Saisiyat)

**17. English: The old man gives the father the money. [The old man does not really want to give the father any money]**
*   **Answer:** `Tatini’ mobay ka rayhil no yaba’.`
*   **Segmentation:** `Tatini’` | `mobay` | `ka rayhil` | `no yaba’`
*   **Justification:** DO = `ka rayhil`; IO is emotionally distant/disliked → `no yaba’`.

**18. English: The mother offers the money to the child. [The mother is happy to give her child money]**
*   **Answer:** `‘Oya’ saeoe ka rayhil ka korkoring.`
*   **Segmentation:** `‘Oya’` | `saeoe` | `ka rayhil` | `ka korkoring`
*   **Justification:** mother happy/closely related → IO marked `ka`.

**19. English: The child offers sweet potato to the sibling. [It is the child’s own sibling]**
*   **Answer:** `Korkoring saeoe ka ‘aewpir ka ‘aehael.`
*   **Segmentation:** `Korkoring` | `saeoe` | `ka ‘aewpir` | `ka ‘aehael`
*   **Justification:** sibling = close kin → `ka` on IO.

**20. English: He offers pork to the foreigner. [He does not know the foreigner]**
*   **Answer:** `Sia saeoe ka ayam no amilika.`
*   **Segmentation:** `Sia` | `saeoe` | `ka ayam` | `no amilika`
*   **Justification:** foreigner is not known → emotional/social distance → `no`.
