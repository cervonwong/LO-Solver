# Core Grammatical Generalizations

1.  **Word Order:** Subject — Verb — [(`ka`) Direct Object] — [(`ka` / `no`) Indirect Object].
2.  **Indirect Object / Recipient (IO):** Choice between `ka` and `no` is pragmatic:
    *   `ka` = proximate / close (physical proximity, kinship/own child, positive affect, physically handing).
    *   `no` = distant / alienated (spatial distance, sending/writing, emotional distance / dislike, strangers).
3.  **Pronouns:** Reflect the same distinction:
    *   `hisia` = proximate
    *   `‘inisia` = distant

## Distribution Matrix (Recipient Marking)

| Verb | Recipient Marking | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `komaat` (write) | `no` | Writing implies distance (recipient not present). |
| `somatel` (send) | `no` | Sending implies distance. |
| `mobay` (give) | `ka` or `no` | `ka` if recipient is own/close/present; `no` if distant/alienated. |
| `saeoe` (offer) | `ka` or `no` | Context determines choice (proximate vs distant). |
| `pasibaeaeh` (lend) | `ka` or `no` | Context determines choice (closeness vs distance). |

# Detailed Breakdowns

## Part 1 (Translate into Saisiyat)

**10. English: The child writes mother a letter.**
*   **Answer:** `Korkoring komaat ka kinaat no 'oya'.`
*   **Segmentation:** `korkoring` (child) + `komaat` (write) + `ka kinaat` (DO: a letter) + `no 'oya'` (IO: mother)
*   **Justification:** Writing implies distance (recipient not physically present), so the recipient "mother" is marked with `no`.

**11. English: The father gives him some aubergine. [The father is angry with him]**
*   **Answer:** `Yaba' mobay ka talor 'inisia.`
*   **Segmentation:** `yaba'` (father) + `mobay` (give) + `ka talor` (DO: aubergine) + `'inisia` (IO: him/distant)
*   **Justification:** Anger implies emotional distance/alienation, so the distant pronoun `'inisia` is used for the recipient.

**12. English: She gives him some sweet potato. [She is not angry with him]**
*   **Answer:** `Sia mobay ka 'aewpir hisia.`
*   **Segmentation:** `sia` (she) + `mobay` (give) + `ka 'aewpir` (DO: sweet potato) + `hisia` (IO: him/proximate)
*   **Justification:** No anger implies emotional closeness/positive affect, so the proximate pronoun `hisia` is used for the recipient.

**13. English: The child offers the old man some sweet potato. [The old man is away in hospital, and the child orders some sweet potato into hospital for him]**
*   **Answer:** `Korkoring saeoe ka 'aewpir no tatini'.`
*   **Segmentation:** `korkoring` (child) + `saeoe` (offer) + `ka 'aewpir` (DO: sweet potato) + `no tatini'` (IO: old man)
*   **Justification:** The old man is physically distant (away in hospital, receiving via order), so `no` marks the recipient.

## Part 2 (Translate into English)

**14. Saisiyat: Yaba' mobay ka rayhil 'inisia.**
*   **Answer:** The father gives him money. [Context: The father is reluctant/distant — e.g., he doesn't like him, or he's giving money to someone emotionally distant]
*   **Segmentation:** `yaba'` (father) + `mobay` (give) + `ka rayhil` (DO: money) + `'inisia` (IO: him/distant pronoun)
*   **Justification:** The distant pronoun `'inisia` indicates emotional distance or alienation between the father and the recipient.

**15. Saisiyat: 'Oya' pasibaeaeh ka kaibaaen no korkoring.**
*   **Answer:** The mother lends the child some clothes. [Context: The child is distant — e.g., away from home, or not the mother's own child, or emotional distance]
*   **Segmentation:** `'oya'` (mother) + `pasibaeaeh` (lend) + `ka kaibaaen` (DO: clothes) + `no korkoring` (IO: child/distant)
*   **Justification:** The marker `no` indicates the child is distant (physically away, or not her own child, or emotional distance).

**16. Saisiyat: 'Oya' pasibaeaeh ka kaibaaen ka korkoring.**
*   **Answer:** The mother lends the child some clothes. [Context: The child is close — e.g., it is her own child, or the child is physically present]
*   **Segmentation:** `'oya'` (mother) + `pasibaeaeh` (lend) + `ka kaibaaen` (DO: clothes) + `ka korkoring` (IO: child/proximate)
*   **Justification:** The marker `ka` indicates the child is close (her own child, or physically present for handover).

## Part 3 (Translate into Saisiyat)

**17. English: The old man gives the father the money. [The old man does not really want to give the father any money]**
*   **Answer:** `Tatini' mobay ka rayhil no yaba'.`
*   **Segmentation:** `tatini'` (old man) + `mobay` (give) + `ka rayhil` (DO: money) + `no yaba'` (IO: father/distant)
*   **Justification:** Reluctance/unwillingness implies emotional distance or alienation, so `no` marks the recipient.

**18. English: The mother offers the money to the child. [The mother is happy to give her child money]**
*   **Answer:** `'Oya' saeoe ka rayhil ka korkoring.`
*   **Segmentation:** `'oya'` (mother) + `saeoe` (offer) + `ka rayhil` (DO: money) + `ka korkoring` (IO: child/proximate)
*   **Justification:** Happiness and "her child" both indicate closeness/positive affect, so `ka` marks the recipient.

**19. English: The child offers sweet potato to the sibling. [It is the child's own sibling]**
*   **Answer:** `Korkoring saeoe ka 'aewpir ka 'aehael.`
*   **Segmentation:** `korkoring` (child) + `saeoe` (offer) + `ka 'aewpir` (DO: sweet potato) + `ka 'aehael` (IO: sibling/proximate)
*   **Justification:** "Own sibling" indicates kinship closeness, so `ka` marks the recipient.

**20. English: He offers pork to the foreigner. [He does not know the foreigner]**
*   **Answer:** `Sia saeoe ka ayam no amilika.`
*   **Segmentation:** `sia` (he) + `saeoe` (offer) + `ka ayam` (DO: pork) + `no amilika` (IO: foreigner/distant)
*   **Justification:** Not knowing someone implies social/emotional distance (stranger), so `no` marks the recipient.
